(This doc is just for laying out my ideas for the project)


Authors: Lilith Tundrus

What this project is:

A DOS Edit-like program that lets you edit text in a 'graphical' way while still using the CLI

What this project is NOT:

It's not intended to be used seriously but is merely practice for me on a semi-complex project
if it ends up being usable yay!

Some base alpha features:
- Open Files
- Get the current directory for saving files
- Write (text based) files to disk
- Support file sizes above 16k
- Line + Column count
- Menu system
- Undo/Redo system
- Cut/Copy/Paste support
- Title that matches the current document
- Keyboard shortcuts
- About dialog
- Open dialog
- Save dialog
- Selectable text (visually select text to edit/copy/cut)
- Command line args for opening files

Nice-to-haves:

- Syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion
- Find and replace
- Some sort of preferences system
- Tabbed workspace
